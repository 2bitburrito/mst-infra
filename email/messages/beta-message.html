<p>I really appreciate you joining the beta for Meta Sound Tools. I’ve been refining this tool for nearly a year, and
  it’s
  finally at a stage where I’d love your feedback.</p>
<p>One thing I need to stress is that this is still in a working beta. Please ensure that you retain backups for any
  files which you
  are mutating with the program. The only truly destructive operation is the "Save All" button which will take all of
  your edited files and rewrite the metadata within the audio files. If there is a failure during this operation there
  is a small (but non-zero) chance that it could corrupt a file.</p>
<p>Please click the link below to create an account and download the program. There's an introduction video to get
  you started there if that's your vibe. Otherwise open it up and have a look around. If you encounter any issues or
  have any feedback at all there is a bug-report/feedback button in the app - this is generally the best option for any
  bugs as We're able to see the internal stack traces and errors from the app. Alternatively please don't hesitate to
  reach out via hello@metasoundtools.com for anything at all.</p>
<p>Thanks and I hope that MST is as useful a tool in your workflow as it has been for mine!</p>
