Thanks for agreeing to be a part of this beta program. I've been working tirelessly on this program for nearly a year
and I'm really happy with how it's working. There's still lots of things I'd like to add in the coming months but it's
got some great features now which I'm really proud of.

One thing I need to stress is that this is still in a working beta. You MUST retain backups for any files which you are
mutating with the program. The only truly destructive operation is the "Save All" button which will take all of your
edited files and rewrite the metadata within the audio files. If there is a failure during this operation there is a
small (but non-zero) chance that it could corrupt a file.

Please click through the link below to create an account and download the program. There's an introduction video to get
you started there if that's your vibe. Otherwise open it up and have a click around. If you encounter any issues or have
any feedback at all there is a bug-report/feedback button in the app - this is generally the best option for any bugs as
I'm able to see the internal stack traces and errors from the app. Alternatively please don't hesitate to reach out via
hello@metasoundtools.com for anything at all.

Thanks and I hope that MST is as useful a tool in your workflow as it has been for mine!
